      <p>
        Welcome! I'm Regha Abraham, and this blog is my personal journal as I grow into a great software developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, I share what I learn daily - from React fundamentals to real-world app building - and document my progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mission is to learn consistently, build with intention, and help others grow through what Iâ€™ve learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to follow along!
