// The App component serves as the root of the application, displaying a header and a list of blog posts.
// The posts are passed to the Post component, which handles displaying each post's title and content.
// The Header component is displayed at the top of the page, providing a consistent header for the blog.
// The App component is the main entry point for the React application, rendering the header and a list of posts.
